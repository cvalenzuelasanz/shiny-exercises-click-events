# Shiny exercise
# Gather click events (click, double click and hover) from
# a simple scatterplot of mpg dataset
#
# Requirements:
# - The output of those events should be inside a tabset with 
#   three tabs, one for each event type
# - Inside each tab it have to show a table outputs all the
#   variables of the related data points (points user clicked on
#   or hover over...)
# - You can use any numeric variables for each axis in the plot of
#   the dataset
#
# This material is on a git repository to show how I develop it
# and in which order I started. This could be a help for students
# without prior programming experience.
# Specially made to teach good programming practise and first
# approach to git.
